### Section line
Made for small businesses that already sell on WhatsApp every day.

### Subtext
Boutiques, grocery shops, home chefs, wholesalers, resellers, and more.

## PROBLEM SECTION

### Section title
Tired of messy WhatsApp chats and half-written orders?

### Body copy
Your customers send random photos, old prices, and "What's the rate?" messages.
You scroll through long chats to find sizes, colours, and addresses.
Orders get confused. Deliveries get delayed. Everyone gets frustrated.

### Highlight paragraph
mywabiz turns that chaos into one clean, complete order message on WhatsApp – with all products, quantities, variants, and address in one place.

### Short bullet list – "Without mywabiz vs with mywabiz"

**Without mywabiz:**
- "Price please?" for the same product again and again.
- Addresses hidden somewhere in old chats.
- No clear record of how many orders you actually got.

**With mywabiz:**
- Customers see all products and prices on one link.
- They fill their details once, in a short form.
- You receive one structured order message you can trust.

### Card 3 – Home chefs & tiffin services
List today's menu, capture address and delivery time in a structured form, not voice notes.
